# PopulationPerCountry
Personal Project to familiarize myself to BeautifulSoup library.
A simple web scraping script using BeautifulSoup (bs4) and requests extracts information such as country name, country land size, global ranking based on population count, population count, urban population and percentage, and fertility rate per year by retrieving data from the website (https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/).


It can be saved as a text file, a JSON file, or in a MySQL database.


> Note
install the library below:

```bash
pip install bs4
```


```bash
pip install requests
```

# PopulationPerCountry
Personal Project.
A simple web scraping script using BeautifulSoup (bs4) and requests extracts information such as country name, country land size, global ranking based on population count, population count, urban population and percentage, and fertility rate per year by retrieving data from the website (https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/).



> Note
install the library below:

```bash
pip install bs4
```


```bash
pip install requests
```
